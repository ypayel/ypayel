- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Artsiom Kukankou, Iâ€™m 21 years old, I also graduated from technical school with a degree in computer science technology. There I learned what programming is.
-  The languages â€‹â€‹I studied there were HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, C++ and a little C Sharp.
-  Then I had a year break, to think about whether I needed this programming and I came to the conclusion that this is exactly the profession in which I can develop and learn new things throughout my career.
-  So that's why I'm here
-  Iâ€™ve been living in Poland for more than 6 years, I really fell in love with this country and the people who live here 
-  
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in a company that would be happy to take me under its wing and help me gain first experience in this profession. I love to study, I am full of energy and hunger for knowledge and new challenges. I will try my best
- 
-  ðŸŒ± At the moment I am studying at the Software Devoleper Accademy in Poland, I wanted to repeat the material that I had studied before and gain new knowledge, become even more self-confident and naturally a more competent candidate
-  I started the course itself in October 2023. Course ends June 2024
